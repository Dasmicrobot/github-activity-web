    <h1>General announcement</h1>
    <p>2021 February. Work on a new application has begun. A couple of developers will build a solution to the tiny problem. Currently, it is tricky to get the results of the recent developer activity, which repositories they have committed to and at what times.</p>
    <p>The web-facing application will allow developers to check their past commit activity. After logging in using Github and obtaining a secret token, the application will compile available data and present it to the user. The application code will be under the GPL licence.</p>
    <p>Compiled data should help with filling in timesheets, understand activity patterns.</p>
